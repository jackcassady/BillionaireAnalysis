Analysis of the top 100 billionaires from 2010 - 2015

# Analysis of the World's Billionaires #

By: Jack Cassady

In the project I will be analyzing data from the Forbes Billionaires list, using the
top 100 richest people on the list from 2010 to 2015. With my analysis in the project,
I hope to find the characteristics and industries that make up the richest people in the
world. I will be looking at which industries have produced the most wealth as well as
which ones are changing at the fastest rates, as well as which nations produce the highest
amount of billionaires on the list and look at how gender effects wealth. Along with seeing
how these people have gained their wealth, my goal is to see how they compare with the rest
of the world by comparing against the world GDP from each of these years.

## Data ##

The data used to conduct my analysis was acquired from Forbes. It lists the
top 100 richest people in the world; in total there are 6 datasets that contain
information about each person in the list from 2010 to 2015. This information
includes, Rank, Name, Net Worth, Age, Nationality and after 2010 includes
the Source of Wealth. In addition to these original categories, the data has been
modified to include Gender and Industry.

The descriptions for each of these categories are listed below.

* Rank: The rank column shows the rank of the person in the list of billionaires.
  It includes ties and assists in showing changes to the list year by year.
* Name: Lists the name of the billionaire.
* Net Worth: Net worth shows the total estimated wealth for each person in the
list for the year that the data was recorded. This data is listed in terms of US dollars
and is in units of 1 billion.
* Age: Age is the age of the person in the year that that the data was recorded if applicable.
Some of the individuals on the list are listed in pairs or has combined wealth with family
members so an age is not applicable in such a case.
* Gender: This is the gender of the person on the list if applicable. Like with Age, the data
contains pairs or families, if the pairs contained individuals of opposite gender
the gender column was omitted.
* Nationality: Lists the country from which the individual resides.
* Source(s) of Wealth: Documents the major source of each person's wealth. This column is
only available after the 2010 dataset and lists either a specific company or industry that
contributed to the majority of total wealth.
* Industry: Industry is a more specific documentation of the source of wealth, categorizing each person into a specific industry or category of industry. There are 14 categories of industry utilized by Forbes, these are: Technology, Fashion & Retail, Finance, Telecom, Media & Entertainment, Energy, Real Estate, Gambling & Casinos, Food & Beverage, Automotive, Manufacturing, Mining, Healthcare, Logistics, and Diversified. Below is a description of each of these categories.
  * Technology: Contains industries that focus on creating new technology or innovations. This category is primarily software and internet technology.
  * Fashion & Retail: Contains high fashion and retail brands.
  * Finance: Financial industries and investors.
  * Telecom: Television and phone technology providers.
  * Media & Entertainment: Traditional media such news providers combined with celebrities and the movie industry
  * Energy: Energy providers; this also includes oil companies and gas refinement.
  * Real Estate: Real Estate developers and construction.
  * Gambling & Casinos: Industries that offer gambling.
  * Food & Beverage: Process and distribute food. This also includes packaging.
  * Automotive Producers of cars and trucks. While he could be considered a part of the technology industry, Elon Musk will be included here since his primary product is cars.
  * Manufacturing: Assembles or manufactures goods to sell to consumers or retail brands.
  * Mining: Large scale mining of ores such as gold, silver, or coal. This does not include oil drilling.
  * Healthcare: Healthcare providers such as hospitals or pharmaceuticals.
  * Logistics: Major shipping companies.
  * Diversified: Any individual whose majority of wealth did not come from a sole industry.
  
## Results ##
### Overall Analysis of Billionaires ###
I began my analysis by looking at the billionaires as a whole. My goal was to see how the wealth
of billionaires had changed over the time period I would be looking at. This includes the growth
of total wealth, then comparing how the total wealth had changed in comparison to the Global
GDP and analyzing how wealth changes as they get older.
