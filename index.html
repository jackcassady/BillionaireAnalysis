    <p>In the project I will be analyzing data from the Forbes Billionaires list, using the<br> top 100 richest people on the list from 2010 to 2015. With my analysis in the project,<br> I hope to find the characteristics and industries that make up the richest people in the<br> world. I will be looking at which industries have produced the most wealth as well as<br> which ones are changing at the fastest rates, as well as which nations produce the highest<br> amount of billionaires on the list and look at how gender effects wealth. Along with seeing<br> how these people have gained their wealth, my goal is to see how they compare with the rest<br> of the world by comparing against the world GDP from each of these years.
